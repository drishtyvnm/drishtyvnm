<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Drishty Singh</h1>
<h3 align="center">Final year student of Master's in Mathematical Sciences. My research interests span from Mathematics to Mathematical AI. </h3>

- Currently I am learning about the concepts of *Dynamic Mode Decomposition* (DMD). 

- Comprehended the crucial concepts of *Linear operators for Quantum Mechanics* in Summer Research Internship at **Indian Institute of Technology**, IIT- Hyderabad.

- Learnt about *Lorenz Equation* developed by Edward Lorenz who constructed a highly simplified model of a convecting fluid. This simple model also displays a wide variety of behavior and for some parameter values is chaotic. Thus, the surprising conclusion derived by Lorenz is now popularly known as *butterfly effect*. 

- Developed third order derivative of a function related to a *Hermite Polynomial*.
