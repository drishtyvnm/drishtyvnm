<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Drishty Singh</h1>
<h3 align="center">Final year student of Master's in Mathematical Sciences. My research interests span Functional analysis, Complex Analysis, Operator Theory, Linear Algebra, Quantum Mechanics and advanced Mathematical techniques.</h3>

- Currently I am grasping the concepts of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)) [DMD](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19_bIL0d-jeJA4ch3NINJGA523fKRXruR#scrollTo=J9eawEBescHn)

- Comprehended the crucial concepts of Linear operators for Quantum Mechanics in Summer Research Internship at IIT- Hyderabad **Linear operators for Quantum Mechanics**

- Learnt about Lorenz Equation developed by Edward Lorenz who constructed a highly simplified model of a convecting fluid. This simple model also displays a wide variety of behavior and for some parameter values is chaotic. Thus, the surprising conclusion derived by Lorenz is now popularly known as butterfly effect.
